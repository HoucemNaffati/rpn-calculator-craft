## Sandbox  suggestions
#### [Feature Extension]
* Ability to apply an operand in a cumulative way: new commands 'add all', 'subtract all'...
* Ability to apply trigonometric functions in the same way as commands: 'cosine', 'tangent', 'sine'...  

#### [Architecture refactoring/new Features introduction]
Preserve history so we can navigate over time and introduce new commands such as: 
+ undo to the previous stack state
+ redo the last stack state
+ reset to a any previous state
